What is this:
=============

Hi!
This is a program about a guy walking around.

The user can control the direction of where he is going using the arrow keys and watch him from top down.

That's way cool, isn't it?


TODO:
=====

* Hero should be visible while standing
* not beeing able to walk through walls
* transparency handled correctly
